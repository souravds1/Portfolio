Point clouds are unstructured representations of 3D models that contain the (X, Y, Z)
coordinates of points representing the surface of an object. In this assignment, you will
train a deep learning model for object classification and segmentation using point clouds
from the ScanObjectNN dataset, a real-world dataset of scanned 3D objects with 15
categories (e.g., chair, table, desk). The dataset is available at https://github.com/
hkust-vgd/ScanObjectNN. The task involves implementing and optimizing PointNet
and PointNet++ frameworks using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
1. Read the PointNet arXiv paper for a brief understanding of the implementation and
the model. Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593
2. Read the PointNet++ arXiv paper, which builds on PointNet with hierarchical
feature learning. Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413
3. Implement the PointNet framework using TensorFlow/PyTorch as given in the
GitHub link: https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet. Use the ScanObjectNN
dataset for classification and part segmentation (Chair class only) tasks. Experiment
with hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of points sampled) to
improve performance on the dataset.
4. Repeat step 3 for the PointNet++ framework as given in the GitHub link: https:
//github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2. Compare the performance of both models
using metrics like classification accuracy and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
for segmentation.
5. In your presentation video, discuss the performance of both models with accuracy
and mIoU plots, and show examples of correctly and incorrectly classified or seg-
mented objects. Highlight challenges (e.g., handling noisy real-world scans) and
suggest improvements, such as data augmentation or incorporating more robust
feature extraction techniques.
