This study investigates the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to the synthesis of
2D microstructure images for computational materials design. A custom data-loading pipeline
was developed in PyTorch to handle binary microstructure images and to generate paired
clean/noisy examples via three distinct perturbation models: salt-and-pepper flips, structured
sinusoidal grid overlays, and frequency-domain masking using FFT. The resulting dataset
feeds into a denoising VAE framework that learns latent representations robust to diverse
noise patterns. We further refine samples by training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) in the
learned latent space, demonstrating that the diffusion process improves generation fidelity.
Multi-modal noise augmentation and latent-space diffusion jointly yield high-quality synthetic
microstructure realizations
