**Fatigue & Fracture Mechanics: Crack Propagation in Orthopedic Bone Fractures**

Project: 
**Title: Study of the interaction of various forces with failure crack propagation during typical orthopedic bone fracture**

Abstract: Bone is a naturally occurring composite substance with remarkable strength and toughness due to its internal hierarchical structure. 
Despite its unique characteristics, bone also has a semi-brittle behavior and can still experience fractures caused by accidents and surgeries. 
This paper will delve into the study of failure mechanisms in bone influenced by standard procedures in orthopedic surgeries and accidents. The 
understanding of bone fracture patterns caused by osteotomy (bone cutting) and bone damage during accidents is critical to properly treating patients
during postoperative recovery. Researchers have been involved in understanding bone failure for decades through in-house lab experiments and simulation. 
In this work, we will summarize a branch of literature survey on different failure understanding of the bone that has already been reported. Our primary 
focus will center on the damage to healthy bones due to variousloading conditions, particularly affecting the bones in the legs. Finally, we will attempt 
to describe experimental techniques and numerical models for bone failure using standard and controlled loading conditions, which replicate typical bone 
damage during typical orthopedic fracture
