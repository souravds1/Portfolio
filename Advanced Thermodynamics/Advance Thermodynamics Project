Project: Comprehensive Study of Liquid-Air and Compressed Air Energy Storage 
Abstract: Continuous and clean energy generation is the goal of all energy researchers. Research is going 
towards this goal. This report discusses some of the thermodynamic solutions CAES and LAES for electrical 
energy storage based on the Carnot Battery cycle. The process flow diagram and the different components of 
the systems have been presented. The benefit of Carbon di Oxide as a storage medium is also discussed. Some 
current and future utilization of this system other than electricity generation are also mentioned. Current 
constraints and limitations, along with some solutions to the system are also analyzed in this report.
