**Sourav Das â€“ GitHub Portfolio**


I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University, with 4 years of industry experience as a piping stress engineer and 2.5 years of research experience in electrochemistry, battery technology, and 2D materials. This repository showcases my class projects, demonstrating my expertise in computational modeling, materials science, and energy storage.

Featured Projects:
a) Advanced Thermodynamics: Liquid-Air & Compressed Air Energy Storage Analysis.
b) Advanced Biosensors: (1) Glucose Oxidase Biosensor Fabrication, (2) Carbon Dots Synthesis for Iron Sensing
c) Micro & Nano Mechanics: Li-ion Battery Modeling (Doyle-Fuller-Newman Model)
d) Computational Materials Science: Reactive MD Simulations for Methane Decomposition to Graphene & Hydrogen.
e) Solid Modeling & GPU Computing: 2D Heat Transfer Simulation Using CUDA.
f) Fatigue & Fracture Mechanics: Failure Crack Propagation in Orthopedic Bone Fractures.
This portfolio highlights my ability to integrate computational techniques with experimental research to solve real-world engineering challenges.
